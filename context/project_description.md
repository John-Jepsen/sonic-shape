# Project Description

## Classically Punk
Music experts have been trying to understand sound and what differentiates one song from another for a long time. What makes a tone different from another? Can we visualize sound and if yes, how? Audio files contain a lot of data, and our goal is to understand what an audio file is, the data it contains, and what we can do with that data. What features can we visualize on this kind of data?

## Your Mission
Your first mission will be to find a library that "reads" music. (Computers don't listen to music, they read it.) Then your second mission will be to separate a collection of music files into different music genres, and to do so, you will need to be able to first identify features inside the music files that will be used for classification.

### What to expect
Build an application in Python that automatically classifies different musical genres from an audio snippet. You should expect to handle large data sets. You should also expect to analyze media files to generate data and identify patterns.

### Deliverables
- A presentation with slides on how you classified the music, as well as assumptions, implications, and other important information.
- Code that the DevOps team should be able to push to production.

### Technical specifications
- Implement a multi-variable linear regression model on a large and complex data set.
- Analyze and evaluate the implications of your model on real-life users.
- Analyze and evaluate the risk to the business of the impact, assumptions, and decisions in your model.

### Learning outcomes: the five stages of your project
- Data Collecting / Cleaning
- Data Exploration
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning
- Communication

## Data Source
Music Data Set ~1.2 GB. This dataset was used for the well-known paper in genre classification "Musical genre classification of audio signals" by G. Tzanetakis and P. Cook in IEEE Transactions on Audio and Speech Processing 2002. Work directly from your computer for this project rather than uploading into Docode.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how digital audio works: what an audio file is, what data it stores, and which features describe sound (e.g., tempo, pitch, timbre, loudness).
- Use a Python audio library to load audio files, extract numeric features, and visualize them.
- Design and run a full data pipeline: collect and clean the dataset, explore it, and build visualizations that reveal patterns across genres.
- Implement and train a multivariable linear regression model on a large, noisy dataset for genre-related prediction or scoring.
- Evaluate model performance and limitations, and reason about how errors affect real users and business decisions.
- Communicate your approach and results clearly in slides: assumptions, feature choices, modeling decisions, risks, and production concerns.
- Write production-ready Python code that a DevOps team pushes to production without major refactoring.
